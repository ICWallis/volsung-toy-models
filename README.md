# Volsung Toy Models

Simple finite element, heat- and mass-transfer models designed to teach geothermal reservoir physics. 

Models developed by Irene Wallis, Cubic Earth https://www.cubicearth.nz/

Flow State Solutions sponsored a licence of Volsung for this project https://www.flowstatesolutions.co.nz/

## Model Descriptions

### 1) Conduction

#### Concept

Illustrates a conductive thermal gradient of XXX degC/km. 

There are to conduction models:
- One with consistent rock thermal conductivity 
- Another where rock thermal conductivity is varied

#### Paramaters

All rock types have permeability of XXX mD (i.e., below the limit for convection).

Rock A:

Rock B:

Rock C:

#### Grid

Tarten grid with XX elements

### 2) Single Fault

#### Concept
A single fault with high vertical permeability within a relatively low permeability host rock. A conductive thermal gradient of XXX degC/km is implemented without additional upflow elements (i.e., there is no additional injection of heat and mass into the fault zone). Subsequently, the convection cell, both upward and downward components, form inside the fault.
